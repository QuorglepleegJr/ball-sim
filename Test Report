Testing report:

Tested multiple angles of simple 2 ball collisions, non-obliquely. All of these passed as expected, albeit with seemingly odd behaviour
if both were moving in the same direction but still collided, where the slower ball completely stopped. However, upon reviewing the intent of the code,
this is the expected behaviour, and would be corrected upon the completetion of the full collisions, rather than simply preventing balls passing through
each other.

Tested multiple angles of oblique collision between 2 balls, all functioned as expected.

Performed all of the previous tests, but with added gravity, and everything appeared to go as expected.

Tested 3 balls colliding completely both non-obliquely and obliquely, both with and without gravity, again everything appeared fine.

Tested 4 balls colliding in a square both with and without gravity, some odd behaviour found. Observed on one instance of the test two of the balls
stop in midair - after conducting further looks, the cause of the problem appears to be floating point error in calculations of the velocity and position,
possibly related to rotating. As of now, no easy solution presents itself, however the best cause of action would be to analyse where the error is arising and
use less error-prone methods.

Summary:

The program appears to work as intended, except for a mild case of floating point error that is currently unfixable.
