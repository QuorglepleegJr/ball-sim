SCENARIOS TO TEST:

- Basic: Two balls heading dead on

       (500, 300, -100, 0),
       ),
frame_advance=False

PASSED x2

OR:

balls=((300, 200, 0, 100),
       (300, 500, 0, -100),
       ),
frame_advance=False

PASSED, PASSED*

- Basic: Two balls heading diagonally on

balls=((200, 300, 100, 100),
       (500, 300, -100, 100),
       ),
frame_advance=False

PASSED x2

OR:

balls=((300, 200, 30, 100),
       (300, 500, 30, -100),
       ),
frame_advance=False

PASSED, PASSED*

- Basic: Two balls heading slightly obliquely

balls=((200, 325, 100, 0),
       (500, 300, -100, 0),
       ),
frame_advance=False

PASSED, PASSED*

OR:

balls=((300, 200, 0, 100),
       (305, 500, 0, -100),
       ),
frame_advance=False

PASSED x2

- Basic: All previous with gravity

- Basic: Two balls, both moving in same direction

balls=((100, 300, 200, 0),
        (300, 300, 100, 0),
        ),
frame_advance=False

PASSED*

(* means appears to fail but actually works as intended,
in this case, the balls appear to stop but when the collision
would be handled properly that would cease being a problem)

- Moderate: Three balls colliding in line ( + gravity)

balls=((50, 400, 100, 0),
        (550, 400, -100, 0),
        (300, 200, 0, 100)
        ,)
frame_advance=False

PASSED x2

- Moderate: Three balls colliding at angles

balls=((100, 400, 100, 0),
        (500, 400, -100, 0),
        (300, 200, 0, 100)
        ,)
frame_advance=False

PASSED

- Advanced: Four balls coming in from corners (+ gravity)

balls=((100, 100, 100, 100),
        (300, 100, -100, 100),
        (300, 300, -100, -100),
        (100, 300, 100, -100)
        ),
frame_advance=False

PASSED, FAILED (balls occasionally hang in midair)

REQUIRED FIXES:

- Check conditions to reproduce 4 balls having hanging in midair,
    floating point error involved
